"""This module contains helpers that inspect available modules and platform
specifics to give sane values to aiocoap defaults.

All of this should eventually overridable by other libraries wrapping/using
aiocoap and by applications using aiocoap; however, these overrides do not
happen in the defaults module but where these values are actually accessed, so
this module is considered internal to aiocoap and not part of the API.
