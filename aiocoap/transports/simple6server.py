"""This module implements a TransportEndpoint for UDP based on the asyncio
DatagramProtocol.

This is a simple version that works only for servers bound to a single unicast
address. It provides a server backend in situations when :mod:`.udp6` is
unavailable and :mod:`.simple6` needs to be used for clients.

While it is in theory capable of sending requests too, it should not be used
like that, because it won't receive ICMP errors. (That's bad for the server as
well because it creates amplification surface, but in a client it creates bad
user experience because requests to unavailable servers wait for timeout).

This transport is experimental and likely to change.
